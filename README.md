A simple machine learning exercise is provided as an example here. You should use Jupyter notebooks  to develop your own machine learning exercises. The following criteria hold:

    Choose up to 1 algorithm per group member (i.e. maximum 4 or 5 in total) and a minimum of 3 algorithms from Scikit-learn's Supervised learning methods. Each learning algorithm should result in one file for submission.
    Include (generate or acquire) a minimum of 3 data sets with a minimum of 500 samples each. Use one data set per machine learning algorithm. You may re-use data sets if you choose more than 3 machine learning algorithms.
    At least one of your machine learners must use regression (i.e. approximate a dataset with some unknown function).
    At least one of your machine learners must use classification (learn to distinguish two or more classes of data based on their values)
    Provide appropriate data (numerical performance indicators or plots) to visualise the performance of your machine learners.
     

For your submission:

    Hand up one file per machine learner containing the full workflow for that machine learner (loading/creating data, pre-processing, training, evaluating and visualising outputs).
    Each file should briefly describe the contributions of each group member to the following aspects:
        Training data
        Pre-processing
        Algorithm training and evaluation
        Visualisation of outputs
    Each file should list the sources of applied techniques where you have significantly duplicated 3rd party work. Providing links under the above 4 headings (Training data, Pre-processing, Training and Evaluation/Visualisation) is sufficient. Where you have not used 3rd partly work significantly, please state this explicitly.
    Please note that the Scikit-learn documentation provides many useful examples, which you may use for inspiration, but no more than that.
    Please note the important instructions under Uploads and Submissions pertaining to each group member

 

To make the project run smoothly:

    It can be useful to create a group contract. Please see below for suggestions.
    It can be useful to assign roles (chairing meetings, writing minutes, final hand up, ...) but please note all group members should partake in the core technical assignment.
    Feel free to use the Group Project forum to discuss ideas. This forum is available to all project groups within your group and will allow you to share ideas. There is no between-groups competitive element to this project!
    You all have personal and professional obligations that may preclude your input into the project at varying times. Please plan for this early on.
    Do not add functionality not specifically requested or part of the rubric! If in doubt, please ask your moderator for advice. For example, we don't expect unit tests, exception handling or ability to handle user input.
    It is important to maintain evidence of your own input. Git is a useful tool in this regard. If you are comfortable with git and its branching and merge facilities, please feel free to use a git repository for the whole group. If you are not comfortable with this functionality, it may still be useful to use git as a local repository (without merging contributions from various group members).
